description:
  This custom deck balcony project transformed an underutilized outdoor space into a stunning retreat for the homeowners. We designed and constructed a durable cedar deck with a modern railing system that provides both safety and unobstructed views of the surrounding landscape. The project included proper waterproofing, structural reinforcement, and weather-resistant finishes to ensure longevity in Ontario's variable climate. The deck features built-in seating and planters, creating a perfect space for both entertaining and relaxation.
